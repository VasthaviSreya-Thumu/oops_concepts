# SNAKE AND LADDER GAME (LLD)

There will be two files for creating the low level design, Snake and Ladders. One of them is based on lists and the other one is based on hashmaps.
Both of them work just fine but the lists program has a larger time ecomplexity which is why using hashmaps is more efficient.
